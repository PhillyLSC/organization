We, the LSC Local associated with Philadelphia Democratic Socialists of America (hereinafter “Philly DSA-LSC”) adopt version 1.0 of the [LSC Bylaws](https://dsa-lsc.org/lsc-bylaws/) as our own with the following exemptions, which we consider minor but necessary:

1. Where the bylaws refer to “LSC” we will also assume them to mean “Philly DSA-LSC” except where this would be logically incongruous.
2. Where the bylaws refer to “national meetings” we will assume this to mean “local meetings”.
3. We will not have any required working groups, which is a modification to Art. VI Sec. 1.
4. Quorum polling may be done verbally, which is a modification to Art. VI Sec. 2.
5. Objections to alternate proposals during the voting process will be adjudicated by a vote of the local body. This is a modification to Art. VI Sec. 4.
6. We will explicitly allow proxy voting at meetings, given that a member announces their intent to have a proxy 24 hours before the start of the meeting. This is an addition to Art. VI Sec. 5.
7. Philly DSA-LSC members will be allowed to chair more than two meetings in a row as long as no member raises an objection. This is a modification to Art. VI Sec. 5.
8. Non-members have an explicit right to speak in meetings, which is an addition to Art. VI Sec. 5.
9. Philly DSA-LSC will select local Harassment Grievance Representatives when the membership includes 20 or more eligible representatives; otherwise, harassment complaints will be refered to the national LSC. This is a modification of Art. IX Sec. 4.

Additionally, we affirm the following:

* Acceptance of National DSA’s Guidelines for Effective Communication
* Adherence to the National DSA’s Grievance Policy
* A dedication to progressive meeting procedures, including meeting accessibility and progressive stack
* The rejection of explicit leadership within our group, as outlined in LSC Bylaws, Article IV
* A committment to organize through existing committees of the Philadelphia Democratic Socialists of America whenever possible
* The unique position of Philly DSA-LSC to reach individuals who may not otherwise approach DSA or who may not wish to directly affiliate with DSA at all
* Likewise, our position to reach individuals who may not otherwise approach the national LSC or who may not wish to be active members in national LSC
* Our need to engage in mutual aid with the people of the Philadelphia metropolitan area
* Our need to build dual/alternative power to governments in the Philadelphia metropolitan area, and to work alongside organizations who are already doing so, provided that those organizations’ values are compatible with ours
* Our need to advocate for radical democracy and radical socialism within Philadelphia Democratic Socialists of America
